Overview:
Writing code to do a monte carlo simulation on different blackjack strategies.

Bugs:
Read blackjack.py

Todo:
A more concise betting system as opposed to small vs big bets
Compare against a random or conservative player
Implement "non perfect" player who forgets counts
Possibly implement genetic algorithm to fine tune count


Thoughts:
I need to collect different card counting strategies.
I need to learn how to use matplotlib to do a 3d heatmap of odds
I wonder if the books are right.
