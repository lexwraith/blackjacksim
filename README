Overview:
Writing code to do a monte carlo simulation on different blackjack strategies.

Version History
1.0 -> 	Examine runtest for parameters (count = True, countaccuracy = 100, etc.)
	Runlayer1() is the overarching function to call runtest. Not necessary.
	Currently produces roughly a 50% higher EV than not counting. Roughly
		+.3% per hand using one deck.

Bugs:
Unknown.

Todo:
Optimize runtest().
Format to Pep8 and erase commented code.
Possibly implement genetic algorithm to fine tune count.
Plot/draw data from text files.

Thoughts:
According to Blackjackaudit by Deepnet Tech, 1-6 players has no effect on EV.
There are arbitrary thresholds for truecount indices. This is problematic.
