Overview:
Writing code to do a monte carlo simulation on different blackjack strategies.

Bugs:
The variance is...extreme?

Todo:
A more concise betting system as opposed to small vs big bets
Compare against ANY counting system versus a casual player
Implement "non perfect" player who forgets counts
	Currently the forget chance is .5
Possibly implement genetic algorithm to fine tune count

Thoughts:
According to Blackjackaudit by Deepnet Tech, 1-6 players has no effect on EV.
There are arbitrary thresholds for truecount indices. This is problematic.
I need to collect different card counting strategies.
I need to learn how to use matplotlib to do a 3d heatmap of odds
